Q3 => Explain the difference between local and instance variables?
Ans => 

	A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

		* The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
		* A variable is only a name given to a memory location. All the operations are done on the variable effects of a memory location.
		* In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.
		
	Instance Variable => These variables are declared within a class but outside a method, constructor, or block and always get a default value.
	
		* These variables are usually created when we create an object and are destroyed when the object is destroyed.
		* We may use an access specifier, for instance, variable, and if no access specifier is specified, then the default access specifier is used.
		* Each and every object will have its own copy of instance variables.
		
		For Example
		---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
			class Taxes  
			{  
   				int count; // Count is an Instance variable  
   				/*...*/  
			} 
			
		---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
		
		
	Local Variable: These variables are declared within a method but do not get any default value.
	
		* They are usually created when we enter a method or constructor and are destroyed after exiting the block or when the call returns from the method.
		* Its scope is generally limited to a method and its scope starts from the line they are declared. 
		  Their scope usually remains there until the closing curly brace of the method comes.
		* The initialization of the local variable is mandatory.

			int area()      
			{    
        		int length = 10; // Local variable          
        		int breadth = 5; // Local variable          
        		int rectarea = length*breadth; // Local variable          
        		return rectarea;          
			}
