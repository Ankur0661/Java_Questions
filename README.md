Q1) Explain Type casting and its types with examples?

Q2) Create a class Main with a main method.
This main method has one local variable:
city : String

"Financial city"
if city.equals("Kolkata") then print
"City of Joy"

Q1) The set of positive numbers starting from 1 is known as Natural Numbers. The sum of
the first N natural numbers is given by the formula [N * (N + 1)] / 2 For example, given a
number 5, the sum of the first 5 natural numbers will be[5 * (6)]/2 = 15
● Write a Java class with a static method that will take a number as a parameter, and print the
sum of the natural number from 1 to the number supplied as the method argument.
● Call the above-defined method from the main method of that class by supplying any number
as an argument and print the result.

Q2) The prime factors of a number are all of the integers below that number that are
divisible into the number as well as 1. For example, the prime factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,
and 12.
● Write a Java class with a static method that will take a number and print all the prime factorial
of that number.
● The Supplied number should be between 2 and 100. otherwise, it should print “Invalid
number”.
● Call this method from the main method by supplying any valid argument.
